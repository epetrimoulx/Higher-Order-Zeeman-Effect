    \section{Background and Motivation}
        This dissertation investigates hydrogenic atomic systems subjected to an external magnetic field, and plays a key role in the investigation of the $\mu_g - 2$ anomaly. The Zeeman effect as a whole dates back to before the conception of quantum mechanics, and was one of many key experiments that motivated its discovery. The study of hydrogenic states in quantum mechanics provides a basis for the analysis of all the elements, ions, and isotopes throughout the universe and because they consist only of a nucleus and a single electron, have analytical solutions.
