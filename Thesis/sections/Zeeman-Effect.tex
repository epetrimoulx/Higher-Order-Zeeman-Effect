\chapter{The Higher Order Zeeman Effect}\label{sec:Zeeman-Effect}
    \section{Overview}
        In this chapter the Zeeman Effect is introduced, and the motivation, direct applications, and the higher order Zeeman Effect is discussed. The main focus of this chapter is to show the effect of the quadratic Zeeman Effect, and show how using the magnetic dipole operator in conjunction with the relativistic corrections to $^3$He$^+$ yields a cubic Zeeman Effect. The effects of both the quadratic and cubic corrections are discussed in great detail, and the impact of the effect on high precision measurements is displayed for various magnetic field strengths.\\

        % PUT SOMETHING HERE FOR APPLICATIONS IN AMO
       Sec.~\ref{sec:history} starts with the history of the Zeeman effect, its origins and discovery. Afterwards the motivation for the project in Sec.~\ref{sec:motivation} is discussed. Here, some current experiments in the field such as the $g-2$ experiment conducted at the Max Planck Institute as well as applications to high-precision magnetometry are highlighted. Some additional applications in the field of atomic physics such as $\dots$ are introduced as well. In Sec.~\ref{sec:Ordinary_Zeeman}, the ordinary Zeeman effect is discussed, introducing its theory and application to atomic systems such as $^3$He$^+$. After introducing the ordinary Zeeman effect the quadratic Zeeman effect is introduced, where it is derived using the canonical momentum and a description of its impact on an atom subjected to a magnetic field is given. Moving towards higher order systems, the cubic Zeeman effect is introduced. Starting with the effects that contribute to the cubic Zeeman effect such as the magnetic dipole operator in Sec.~\ref{sec:magnetic_dipole_operator} and relativistic corrections to the $^3$He$^+$ ion in Sec.~\ref{sec:Relativistic_Correction}, these effects are combined to yield a $B^3$ contribution to the energy splitting within the presence of an external magnetic field. Afterwards, Sec.~\ref{sec:results} discusses the results of the calculation and its applications.

    \section{History}\label{sec:history}
        The Zeeman effect was first introduced by Pieter Zeeman, who discovered in 1896 that in the presence of a static magnetic field, spectral lines could be split into many components. After the discovery of quantum mechanics, the behaviour was found to be described as a perturbation of the Hamiltonian using the magnetic moment of the atom and the magnetic field.   
    
        Since it's discovery, the Zeeman effect has played a large role in the field of atomic physics and magnetometry, which is the study of the intensity of magnetic field across space and time. There have been several calculations to include the relativistic corrections \cite{2007Drake-Wu, Drake-Yan}, field inhomogeneities, and quadratic effects in hydrogenic systems \cite{Fontanari_Sadovski√≠_2015}. However, little is known about its behavior in helium atoms such as $^3$He$^+$ and $^3$He, which is of key interest in magnetometry and the muon magnetic moment anomaly $(\mu_g - 2)$, for which there is a 5.0 $\sigma$ discrepancy \cite{aguillard2023measurement} with the standard model prediction.

    \section{Motivation}\label{sec:motivation}
        \subsection{The $g-2$ experiment}\label{sec:g-2}
        The Dirac equation is a very successful and well studied equation in quantum mechanics. Its success comes from its ability to predict 2 important phenomena; the existence of antimatter and the magnetic dipole moment of the electron. The Dirac equation predicts that the magnetic dipole of the electron should be twice that of the classical prediction. This result is expressed in terms of the g-factor which the Dirac equation predicts is equal to 2. While the Dirac prediction is much closer to experimental findings, there is still a difference between the experimentally measured value of g and the equations prediction. This is called the $g-2$ anomaly. The anomaly is represented by


        \begin{align}
            a = \frac{g - 2}{2}\;.
        \end{align}

        \noindent The discrepancy of g is caused by higher-order contributions from quantum field theory and to this day is yet to be properly explained. 

        \begin{align}
            a^{\text{SM}}_\mu = a_\mu^{\text{QED}} + a_\mu^{\text{EW}} + a_\mu^{\text{hadron}}
        \end{align}

        \noindent The first two terms can be derived from first principles, but the hadronic term cannot be calculated precisely on its own and is estimated from experimental results. The effort to measure the muon magnetic moment precisely is an active area of research. The work presented in this thesis aids in the investigation of the $g-2$ anomaly by providing corrections to the Zeeman splitting in $^3$He$+$, the element used in the magnetometry experiment to measure the anomaly. Accounting for higher order corrections to the Zeeman effect may help consolidate the discrepancy between theory and experiment and help researchers further understand the muon magnetic moment and its impact on muonic systems.

        \subsection{High-precision magnetometry}\label{sec:High-Precision-magnetometry}
        \subsection{Connection to Atomic Physics}\label{sec:Connection_To_AMO}

    \section{The Zeeman effect in Hydrogen}\label{sec:Ordinary_Zeeman}
        When an atom is placed in an external magnetic field, its energy levels are shifted. The shifting of energy levels is known as the Zeeman effect. The effect can be written as a perturbation to the Hamiltonian \cite{Griffiths_2018}

        \begin{align}
            \hat{H}_Z = - \left(\vec{\mu_l} + \vec{\mu_s} \right) \cdot \vec{B}\;.
        \end{align}

        \noindent $\mu_l$ is the orbital dipole moment, and $\mu_s$ is the spin magnetic dipole moment, which have the definitions

        \begin{align}
            \vec{\mu_l} &= - \frac{e}{2m} \vec{L} & 
            \vec{\mu_s} &= - \frac{e}{m} \vec{S}
        \end{align}

        \noindent So the first order Zeeman effect Hamiltonian is 
        \begin{align}   
            \hat{H}_Z = \frac{e}{2m} \left( \vec{L} + 2\vec{S} \right) \cdot \vec{B}            
        \end{align}

        \noindent and has the following eigen energy solutions 

        \begin{align}
            E_{n, m_s, m_l} = - \frac{E_0}{n^2} + \mu_B B(m_l + 2m_s)\;.
        \end{align}

        \noindent So it is seen that depending on the magnetic quantum number, the energy levels split apart. Their corresponding new energies depend on this magnetic quantum number as well as the principle quantum number $n$, and scale linearly with magnetic field strength $B$. This is shown effectively in figure~.\ref{fig:a}.
       
    % \section{The Zeeman effect in Helium-3}\label{sec:Ordinary_Zeeman_He3}
    \section{The quadratic Zeeman effect}\label{sec:quadratic_zeeman}
        The quadratic Zeeman effect is derived using the Schrodinger equation and the canonical momentum. The canonical momentum is a conserved quantity that describes a moving charged particle. It can be written as 

        \begin{align}
            \vec{p} = m\vec{v} + e\vec{A}\;.
        \end{align}

        \noindent Where $m\vec{v}$ is the classical definition of the momentum, and $e\vec{A}$ is the extension from electrodynamics that accounts for the impact of an external magnetic field on a charged particle. This term is required in order to ensure that the conservation of momentum holds true, since charged particles subject to an external magnetic field travel in a circular path dependant on the direction of the field.\\
        
        The canonical momentum then is also written in replacement to the typical momentum operator in quantum mechanics, giving the canonical momentum operator 

        \begin{align}
            \hat{p}_{\text{canonical}} = i \hbar \vec{\nabla} + e \hat{A} \;.
        \end{align}

        \noindent Where $\hat{A}$ is the vector potential operator. For an external magnetic field of strength $B$ pointing in the $\hat{k}$ direction the operator becomes 

        \begin{align}
            \hat{A} = \frac{B}{2} \left(y \hat{i} - x \hat{j} \right)\;.
        \end{align}

        \noindent Substituting this in for the vector potential operator in the canonical momentum and placing it into the Hamiltonian equation one gets 

        \begin{align}
            \hat{H} = \frac{\left(i\hbar \vec{\nabla} + \frac{Be}{2}\left(y \hat{i} - x \hat{j} \right)\right)^2}{2m_e} - \frac{Ze^2}{4 \pi \epsilon_0 \vec{r}}\;.
        \end{align}

        \noindent Which when expanded gives
        \small
        \begin{align}
            \hat{H} = \frac{-\hbar^2 \nabla^2}{2m} - \frac{i\hbar e B}{4mc} \vec{\nabla} \cdot \left[y\hat{i} - x\hat{j} \right] - \frac{i\hbar e B}{4mc} \left[y\hat{i} - x\hat{j} \right] \cdot \vec{\nabla} + \frac{e^2B^2}{8mc} \left(x^2 + y^2\right) - \frac{Ze^2}{4\pi \epsilon_0 r}\;.
        \end{align}
        \normalsize

        \noindent The $B^2$ term is the quadratic Zeeman effect and is written on its own as
        \begin{align}
            \hat{H}_Z = \frac{B^2e^2}{8m_e} (x^2 + y^2)\;.
        \end{align}

        \noindent Using $x^2 + y^2 = r^2 - z^2 = \frac{2}{3}r^2\left[ P_0(\cos \theta) - P_2(\cos \theta)\right]$ where $P_2(\cos \theta) = \frac{1}{2}\left(3\cos^2\theta - 1\right)$ and $P_0(\cos \theta) = 1$ are a Legendre polynomials,

        \begin{align}
            \hat{H}_Z = \frac{B^2e^2}{8m_e} (P_0(\cos \theta) - P_2(\cos \theta))\;.
        \end{align}

        % PUT ENERGY EQUATION HERE

        % NOTE: Talk about here why the quadratic Zeeman effect provides a shift to the energy for both possible values of magnetic quantum number evenly, so the overall energy is changed slightly, but the difference between the energy split states remains the same.

            \caption{The Zeeman effect energy splitting for each order}
            \label{fig:overall}
        \end{figure}

        \noindent The total Hamiltonian including the quadratic Zeeman perturbation is then 

        \begin{align}
            \hat{H} = - \frac{\hbar^2}{2m_e} \nabla^2 - \frac{Ze^2}{4\pi \epsilon_0 r} + \frac{B^2e^2}{8m_e} (P_0(\cos \theta) - P_2(\cos \theta))\;. \label{eq:r_sqrd_perturbation}
        \end{align}

        \noindent Where the quadratic Zeeman term is treated as a perturbation. Using the ground state wavefunction of hydrogen for $Z = 2$ for the $^3$He$^+$ atom, the perturbation equation then reads 

        \begin{align}
            \left(- \frac{\hbar^2}{2m_e} \nabla^2 - \frac{Ze^2}{4\pi \epsilon_0 r} - E^{(0)} \right) \vert \psi^{(1)} \rangle = \left(\frac{B^2e^2}{8m_e}r^2 - E^{(1)} \right) \frac{Z^\frac{3}{2} e^{-Zr}}{\sqrt{\pi}}\;.
        \end{align}

        \noindent Where the $P_2(\cos \theta)$ term is zero since the problem involves spherically symmetric $S$ states. This perturbation equation can be solved using the method of Frobenius, where the form of $\vert \psi^{(1)} \rangle$ is assumed to be of a power series.

        \begin{align}
            \vert \psi^{(1)} \rangle = \sum_{j = 0}^\infty Z^{\frac{3}{2}} a_j r^j e^{-Zr}
        \end{align}

        \noindent Inserting $\vert \psi^{(1)} \rangle$ into the perturbation equation the expression reads 

        \begin{align}
            \left(- \frac{\hbar^2}{2m_e} \nabla^2 - \frac{Ze^2}{4\pi \epsilon_0 r} - E^{(0)} \right) \sum_{j = 0}^\infty a_j r^j e^{-Zr} = \left(\frac{B^2e^2}{8m_e}r^2 - E^{(1)} \right) \frac{e^{-Zr}}{\sqrt{\pi}}\;.
        \end{align}

        \noindent Performing the differentiation followed by a shift of summation indices the expression simplifies to
        \begin{align}
            \sum_{j = 0}^\infty \left[ Z(j - 1)a_{j-1} - \frac{j(j+1)}{2}a_j \right]r^{j-2} = -\left(r^2 + E^{(1)} \right) \frac{1}{\sqrt{\pi}}\;.
        \end{align}

        \noindent Using equation \eqref{eq:Energy0_Perturbation}, $E^{(1)}$ is found to be 

        \begin{align}
            E^{(1)} = \frac{-3}{Z^2}\;.
        \end{align}

        \noindent So the final expression before solving the recursion relation in the method of Frobenius yields 
        \begin{align}
            \sum_{j = 0}^\infty \left[ Z(j - 1)a_{j-1} - \frac{j(j+1)}{2}a_j \right]r^{j-2} = -\left(r^2 + \frac{-3}{Z^2} \right) \frac{1}{\sqrt{\pi}}\;.
        \end{align}

        Grouping the powers of $r$ from the LHS and the RHS of the equation produces a set of recursive relations that need to be solved. After substituting the correct integers for $j$ for each equation it is seen that there are only two instances when the series terms are non-zero. These terms are for $j = 2$ and $j = 3$. All other terms in the series are zero and thus non-contributing. The solution for $\vert \psi^{(1)} \rangle$ is thus 

        \begin{align}
            \vert \psi^{(1)} \rangle = \sum_{j = 0}^\infty a_j r^j e^{-Zr} = a_0 e^{-Zr} + a_2 r^2 e^{-Zr} + a_3 r^3 e^{-Zr}
        \end{align}

        \noindent Plugging in the found values for $a_2$ and $a_3$ yield 

        \begin{align}
            \vert \psi^{(1)} \rangle = \sum_{j = 0}^\infty a_j r^j e^{-Zr} = a_0 e^{-Zr} - \frac{1}{Z^2 \sqrt{\pi}} r^2 e^{-Zr} - \frac{1}{3Z \sqrt{\pi}} r^3 e^{-Zr}\;.
        \end{align}
        Currently, $a_0$ is still undetermined. It is found by imposing the orthogonality condition between $\vert \psi^{(0)} \rangle$ and $\vert \psi^{(1)} \rangle$

        \begin{align}
            \langle \psi^{(0)} \vert \psi^{(1)} \rangle = 0\;.
        \end{align}

        This orthogonality relation is a choice, and it not required by any law or rule. It is necessary in order to compute $a_0$ and is only allowed to be chosen due to the nature of the perturbation equation. It exploits the use of the Hermition property of the Hamiltonian that allows the operator to act to the left instead of the right. Multiplying through the original perturbation equation given in \eqref{eq:r_sqrd_perturbation} ensures that $\left(\hat{H} - E^{(0)} \right)$ is zero, implying that any quantity can be can be added to $\vert \psi^{(1)}$ and the equation still holds true. Thus, we can add some amount to $\vert \psi^{(1)} \rangle$ to ensure it is orthogonal without breaking the equality. This is a subtle trick, but one that is necessary to compute the full perturbed wavefunction\footnote{Further explanation of the Hermitian operator rule as well as imposing the orthogonality condition is shown in Appendix~.\ref{sec:Hermitian_Left}}. The $a_0$ coefficient can thus be determined by calculating the integral 
        \begin{align}
            \langle \psi^{(0)} \vert \psi^{(1)} \rangle = \int_0^\infty \int_0^\pi \int_0^{2\pi} r^2 \sin \theta \left(a_0 - \frac{1}{Z^2 \sqrt{\pi}} r^2 - \frac{1}{3Z \sqrt{\pi}} r^3 \right) \frac{Z^{\frac{3}{2}} e^{-2Zr}}{\sqrt{\pi}} = 0\;.
        \end{align}

        \noindent And so $a_0$ is found to be 

        \begin{align}
            a_0 = \frac{11}{2} \frac{1}{Z^4 \sqrt{\pi}}\;.
        \end{align}
        \noindent Thus, the full first order correction to the hydrogenic wavefunction for an atom subject to an external magnetic field is 

        \begin{align}
            \vert \psi^{(1)} \rangle = \frac{Z^{\frac{3}{2}} e^{-Zr}}{\sqrt{\pi}} \left[ \frac{11}{2} \frac{1}{Z^4} - \frac{r^2}{Z^2} - \frac{r^3}{3Z} \right]
        \end{align}


    \section{The Cubic Zeeman Effect}
        The following section discusses the main focus of this thesis, the Cubic Zeeman effect. While the linear Zeeman affect as well as the quadratic Zeeman effect have been studied for hydrogenic systems, little is known about any higher order contributions. This section investigates the combination of the magnetic dipole moment operator and and the quadratic Zeeman effect to determine the relativistic effects of $^3$He$^+$ that when applied, reveal a contribution to the energy shift that is dependant on the cube of the magnetic field strength.

        The section starts out by first introducing the magnetic dipole moment operator ($Q_{M1}$) and discusses its properties and significance to the Zeeman effect. Sec.~\ref{sec:Relativistic_Correction} discusses the combination of the magnetic dipole moment operator with the quadratic Zeeman effect discussed in Sec~.\ref{sec:quadratic_zeeman} to calculate the relativistic corrections to $^3$He$^+$. Accounting for both interactions gives a correction to the energy splitting of $^3$He$^+$ dependant on $B^3$.

        \subsection{The magnetic dipole moment operator}\label{sec:magnetic_dipole_operator}
            The magnetic dipole moment operator represents the interaction of a magnetic dipole moment with an external magnetic field. It is described via the following relation

            \begin{align}
                Q_{M1} = \mu_B \left( 1 - \frac{2p^2}{3m^2 c^2} + \frac{Ze^2}{3mc^2r} \right) \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{B}
            \end{align}

            \noindent Where $\mu_B$ is the Bohr magneton
            
            \begin{align}
                \mu_B = \frac{e \hbar}{2mc}
            \end{align}

            \noindent The second term in the brackets of the magnetic dipole moment operator accounts for the relativistic correction to the kinetic energy of the electron, and the third term is the potential energy due to the Coulomb interaction between the electron and the nucleus. The first term corresponds to the ordinary Zeeman Effect, which does not contribute to the sum over states due to orthogonality.

            The ordinary Zeeman effect contributes to $Q_{M1}$ in $^3$He$^+$ because it has non-zero spin due to the missing electron. For systems such as $^3$He, the ordinary Zeeman effect will not contribute.

            The $Q_{M1}$ operator can be written in terms of the Hamiltonian, which is done as follows

            \begin{align}
                Q_{M1} = \mu_B \left(1 - \frac{4}{3mc^2} \frac{p^2}{2m} + \frac{Ze^2}{3mc^2r} \right) \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{B}
            \end{align}

            \noindent Rearranging the standard Hamiltonian for the $\frac{p^2}{2m}$ term gives

            \begin{align}
                \frac{p^2}{2m} = \hat{H} + \frac{Ze^2}{4\pi \epsilon_0 r}
            \end{align}

            \noindent Substituting into the equation for $Q_{M1}$

            \begin{align}
                Q_{M1} = \mu_B \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{B} + \frac{\mu_B}{3mc^2} \left[-4\left(\hat{H} + \frac{Ze^2}{4\pi \epsilon_0 r} \right) + \frac{Ze^2}{r} \right] \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{B}
            \end{align}

            The operator is now defined only in terms of constants and $r^{-1}$ terms. These terms are combined together for an overall $r^{-1}$ term. The magnetic dipole moment operator is then written as a perturbation of $-r^{-1}$ to the Hamiltonian. Since the $p^2$ is written in terms of the original Hamiltonian, there is not a need to perform a perturbation about $p^2$ in order to receive the desired result.

            % THIS SECTION NEEDS STRENGTHENING - IT IS CURRENTLY WEAK
            % THE JUMP FROM QM1 TO 1/r IS NOT EXPLAINED WELL

            \begin{align}
                \left(H^{(0)} - E^{(0)}\right) \vert \varPsi^{(1)}\rangle = \left( -\frac{1}{r} - E^{(1)} \right) \frac{e^{-Zr}}{\sqrt{\pi}}
            \end{align}

            \noindent Similarly to Sec~.\ref{sec:quadratic_zeeman}, the first order corrected wavefunction is assumed to be of the form of a power series, so that the method of Frobenius can be applied. This gives a similar result to the quadratic Zeeman derivation, but the inhomogeneous terms on the right hand side of the equation now correlate to different powers of $r$.

            \begin{align}
                \sum_{j = 0}^\infty \left[ Z(j-1)a_{j-1} - \frac{j(j+1)}{2} a_j \right] r^{j -2} = \left( \frac{1}{r} - E^{(1)} \right) \frac{-1}{\sqrt{\pi}}
            \end{align}

            \noindent Where $E^{(1)}$ is defined by equation \eqref{eq:Energy0_Perturbation}

            \begin{align}
                E^{(1)} = Z
            \end{align}

            \noindent This gives the final result before the recursion relation step
            \begin{align}
                \sum_{j = 0}^\infty \left[ Z(j-1)a_{j-1} - \frac{j(j+1)}{2} a_j \right] r^{j -2} = \left( \frac{1}{r} + Z \right) \frac{-1}{\sqrt{\pi}}\;.
            \end{align}

            \noindent The recursion relation is solved once again similarly to that of the quadratic Zeeman perturbation, but this time only a single term in the series appears as nonzero. The first order correction to the hydrogenic wavefunction for a $\frac{1}{r}$ perturbation is 

            \begin{align}
                \vert \varPsi^{(1)} \rangle = a_0 e^{-Zr} + a_1 re^{-Zr}
            \end{align}

            \noindent The $a_0$ term is determined by the orthogonality imposed on the system once again and the integration yields 
            
            \begin{align}
                a_0 = \frac{3}{2Z\sqrt{\pi}}\;.
            \end{align}

            Thus the final expression for the correction to the hydrogenic wavefunction for a perturbation of the mangetic dipole operator is 

            \begin{align}
                \vert \varPsi^{(1)} \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\pi}} e^{-Zr} \left( \frac{3}{2Z} - r\right)
            \end{align}

        \subsection{The relativistic correction to $^3$He$^+$}\label{sec:Relativistic_Correction}
            Combining the magnetic dipole moment with the quadratic Zeeman operator, we can write down the relativistic corrections for $^3$He$^+$. Written in terms of pseudostates the relativistic correction is

            \begin{align}
                C_{\text{rel}}^{(2)} =\sum_{\substack{n = 1}}^{\infty}
                \frac{\langle \psi_0 \vert H_Z^{(2)} \vert \psi_n \rangle \langle \psi_n \vert Q_{M1} \vert \psi_0 \rangle}{E_0 - E_n}
            \end{align}
